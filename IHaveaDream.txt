I	am	happy	to	join	with	you	today	in	what	will	go	down	in	history	as	the	greatest	demonstration	for	freedom	in	the	history	of	our	nation	of	hope	to	millions	of	Negro	slaves	who	had	been	seared	in	the	flames	of	withering	injustice	It	came	as	a	joyous	daybreak	to	end	the	long	night	of	their	captivity	hundred	years	later	the	Negro	is	still	languishing	in	the	corners	of	American	society	and	finds	himself	an	exile	in	his	own	land	So	we	have	come	here	today	to	dramatize	a	shameful	condition	of	freedom	and	the	security	of	justice	We	have	also	come	to	this	hallowed	spot	to	remind	America	of	the	fierce	urgency	of	now	This	is	no	time	to	engage	in	the	luxury	of	cooling	off	or	to	take	the	tranquilizing	drug	of	gradualism	Now	is	the	time	to	make	real	the	promises	of	democracy	Now	is	the	time	to	rise	from	the	dark	and	desolate	valley	of	segregation	to	the	sunlit	path	of	racial	justice	Now	is	the	time	to	lift	our	nation	from	the	quick	sands	of	racial	injustice	to	the	solid	rock	of	brotherhood	Now	is	the	time	to	make	justice	a	reality	for	all	of	God	children
Five	score	years	ago	a	great	American	in	whose	symbolic	shadow	we	stand	today	signed	the	Emancipation	Proclamation	This	momentous	decree	came	as	a	great	beacon	light	of	segregation	and	the	chains	of	discrimination	One	hundred	years	later	the	Negro	lives	on	a	lonely	island	of	poverty	in	the	midst	of	a	vast	ocean	of	material	prosperity	One	well	as	white	men	would	be	guaranteed	the	unalienable	rights	of	life	liberty	and	the	pursuit	of	happiness	have	come	to	cash	this	check	a	check	that	will	give	us	upon	demand	the	riches	of	revolt	will	continue	to	shake	the	foundations	of	our	nation	until	the	bright	day	of	justice	emerges	as	long	as	our	children	are	stripped	of	their	selfhood	and	robbed	of	their	dignity	by	signs	stating	For	Whites	Only	We	cannot	be	satisfied	as	long	as	a	Negro	in	Mississippi	cannot	vote	and	a	Negro	in	New	York	believes	he	has	nothing	for	which	to	vote	No	no	we	are	not	satisfied	and	we	will	not	be	satisfied	until	justice	rolls	down	like	waters	and	righteousness	like	a	mighty	stream				
But	one	hundred	years	later	the	Negro	still	is	not	free	One	hundred	years	later	the	life	of	the	Negro	is	still	sadly	crippled	by	the	manacles	and	the	Declaration	of	Independence	they	were	signing	a	promissory	note	to	which	every	American	was	to	fall	heir	This	note	was	a	promise	that	all	men	yes	black	men	as	to	believe	that	there	are	insufficient	funds	in	the	great	vaults	of	opportunity	of	this	nation	So	we	neither	rest	nor	tranquility	in	America	until	the	Negro	is	granted	his	citizenship	rights	The	whirlwinds	come	to	realize	that	their	freedom	is	inextricably	bound	to	our	freedom	We	cannot	walk	alone	be	satisfied																																																																																													
In	a	sense	we	have	come	to	our	nation’s	capital	to	cash	a	check	When	the	architects	of	our	republic	wrote	the	magnificent	words	of	the	Constitution	has	given	the	Negro	people	a	bad	check	a	check	which	has	come	back	marked	“insufficient	funds”	But	we	refuse	to	believe	that	the	bank	of	justice	is	bankrupt	We	refuse	be	content	will	have	a	rude	awakening	if	the	nation	returns	to	business	as	usual	There	will	be	today	have	come	to	realize	that	their	destiny	is	tied	up	with	our	destiny	They	have	the	Negro	basic	mobility	is	from	a	smaller	ghetto	to	a	larger	one	We	can	never																																																																																															
It	is	obvious	today	that	America	has	defaulted	on	this	promissory	note	insofar	as	her	citizens	of	color	are	concerned	Instead	of	honoring	this	sacred	obligation	America	is	an	invigorating	autumn	of	freedom	and	equality	Nineteen	sixty-three	is	not	an	end	but	a	beginning	Those	who	hope	that	the	Negro	needed	to	blow	off	steam	and	will	now	hatred	distrust	of	all	white	people	for	many	of	our	white	brothers	as	evidenced	by	their	presence	here	of	the	highways	and	the	hotels	of	the	cities	We	cannot	be	satisfied	as	long	as																																																																																																															
It	would	be	fatal	for	the	nation	to	overlook	the	urgency	of	the	moment	This	sweltering	summer	of	the	Negro	legitimate	discontent	will	not	pass	until	there	of	gaining	our	rightful	place	we	must	not	be	guilty	of	wrongful	deeds	Let	us	not	seek	to	satisfy	our	thirst	for	freedom	by	drinking	from	the	cup	of	bitterness	and	a	as	long	as	our	bodies	heavy	with	the	fatigue	of	travel	cannot	gain	lodging	in	the	motels	together	to	stand	up	for	freedom	together	knowing	that	we	will	be	free	one	day																																																																																																																
But	there	is	something	that	I	must	say	to	my	people	who	stand	on	the	warm	threshold	which	leads	into	the	palace	of	justice	In	the	process	and	again	we	must	rise	to	the	majestic	heights	of	meeting	physical	force	with	soul	force	The	marvelous	new	militancy	which	has	engulfed	the	Negro	community	must	not	lead	us	to	satisfied	veterans	of	creative	suffering	Continue	to	work	with	the	faith	that	unearned	suffering	is	redemptive	to	jail	Almighty	we	are	free	at	last																																																																																																																									
We	must	forever	conduct	our	struggle	on	the	high	plane	of	dignity	and	discipline	We	must	not	allow	our	creative	protest	to	degenerate	into	physical	violence	Again	civil	rights	When	will	you	be	satisfied	We	can	never	be	satisfied	as	long	as	the	Negro	is	the	victim	of	the	unspeakable	horrors	of	police	brutality	We	can	never	be	the	we	will	be	able	to	work	together	to	pray	together	to	struggle	together	to	go	thank	God																																																																																																																															
As	we	walk	we	must	make	the	pledge	that	we	shall	always	march	ahead	We	cannot	turn	back	There	are	those	who	are	asking	the	devotees	of	Some	of	you	have	come	from	areas	where	your	quest	for	freedom	left	you	battered	by	the	storms	of	persecution	and	staggered	by	the	winds	of	police	brutality	You	have	been	faith	sing	in	the	words	of	the	old	Negro	spiritual	Free	at	last	free	at	last																																																																																																																																	
I	am	not	unmindful	that	some	of	you	have	come	here	out	of	great	trials	and	tribulations	Some	of	you	have	come	fresh	from	narrow	jail	cells	ghettos	of	our	northern	cities	knowing	that	somehow	this	situation	can	and	will	be	changed	Let	us	not	wallow	in	the	valley	of	despair	white	girls	as	sisters	and	brothers	this	and
